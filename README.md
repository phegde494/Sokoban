# Sokoban

This game is modeled after the Japanese puzzle video game with the same name.

To build this game as robustly as possible, we used streamlined object oriented design patterns, backtracking algorithms, dynamic programming, function objects, visitors, generics, inheritance/polymorphism, and extensive testing.

Read UserGuide.txt for information on how to play the game.

Have fun playing!

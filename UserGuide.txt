This game is modeled after Sokoban. To run the program and play the game, follow the instructions below: 


Download and unzip the zip file, which will reveal the “Sokoban” directory. Inside it, there are three directories. You should navigate to the “src” directory and open the “Sokoban.java” file on Eclipse. After making sure the necessary jar files (“javalib.jar” and “tester.jar”) are present in your runtime environment, click the run button to run the program. A sokoban board will pop up, and you can use your arrow keys to move the player in any of the four directions. Players can’t move into walls, and if they move into a hole, both the player and the hole disappear. When the latter happens, the game will end and you will lose. If a player moves into a box or trophy and there’s a blank on the other side of the box/trophy, then the player will push the item to the blank cell and move to the item’s original spot. When anything (player or box/trophy) is moved onto ice, it slides until it comes into contact with another object or a hole. In the former case, it stops; in the latter case, both the hole and object disappear. The point of this game is to cover each of the targets with a trophy of the same color. Once this has been achieved, the game ends and you win. Until the game ends (win or loss) you can undo as many moves as you want by pressing the "u" button. However, keep in mind that your moves counter will increment for each undo that you do. Have fun playing!
